# Apache Kafka ‚Äî Beginner Friendly End-to-End Notes

> Imagine you want to send messages (like WhatsApp) but not between people, instead between **apps and systems**. Kafka is like a **post office** for data ‚Äî apps drop letters (messages), Kafka stores and routes them safely, and other apps pick them up when they want.

This guide explains Kafka in **simple, beginner-friendly language** with examples and comparisons.

## 1. What is Kafka?

Kafka is a **software tool** that helps applications talk to each other using messages. Think of it as a **real-time mailbox system** for computers.

* An app can **send a message** (producer).
* Kafka **stores the message safely**.
* Another app can **read the message later** (consumer).

üì¶ **Example:**

* A shopping website sends an order event (`User bought shoes`).
* Kafka keeps it.
* Another app (billing) picks it up to generate an invoice.
* Another app (shipping) picks it up to arrange delivery.

## 2. Why Do We Need Kafka?

Without Kafka, apps would have to talk directly to each other. This creates **spaghetti connections** ü•¥.

With Kafka, apps just drop messages into a mailbox. Any number of apps can read from that mailbox.

* **Without Kafka** ‚Üí each app talks to all other apps.
* **With Kafka** ‚Üí all apps talk only to Kafka.

## 3. Why Use Kafka?

* **Real-time**: Processes data instantly (e.g., fraud detection).
* **Scalable**: Handles millions of events per second.
* **Reliable**: Doesn‚Äôt lose data (replication).
* **Flexible**: Connects with many databases and systems.

üìä Example Use Cases:

* Banking: Fraud detection.
* E-commerce: Order tracking, recommendation systems.
* Social Media: News feeds.

---

## 4. Core Concepts

* **Broker** ‚Üí Kafka server (post office branch).
* **Topic** ‚Üí A named mailbox (e.g., `orders`, `payments`).
* **Partition** ‚Üí Sub-sections of a mailbox for speed (like dividing work into multiple counters).
* **Offset** ‚Üí Position of a message in a partition (like page number).
* **Producer** ‚Üí Sender of messages.
* **Consumer** ‚Üí Reader of messages.
* **Consumer Group** ‚Üí A team of readers sharing work.

## 5. Kafka Architecture (Post Office Example)

![Kafka Architecture](https://miro.medium.com/1%2AqH6bx8wESbc4IyrGWIZdkg.png)

* Producers put letters in the post office.
* Kafka (post office) keeps letters safe.
* Consumers pick up their letters.
* Kafka ensures letters are not lost even if one branch (broker) fails.

---

## 6. Producers & Consumers

![Producer Consumer](https://kafka.apache.org/images/producer_consumer.png)

### Producer (Sender)

* Decides **which mailbox (topic)** to put the letter in.
* Can send with or without expecting delivery confirmation.

### Consumer (Reader)

* Reads letters from the mailbox.
* Can be one or many. If many, they can share the work.

üì¶ Example: Payment service sends `payment done`. Shipping service reads it.

---

## 7. Topics, Partitions & Offsets

![Topics Partitions](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240604175624/Kafka-Architecture-01-01.webp)

* **Topic** ‚Üí Like a mailbox (`orders`).
* **Partitions** ‚Üí Like dividing the mailbox into drawers. Each drawer has messages in order.
* **Offsets** ‚Üí Each message has a number so consumers know where they left off.

üìù Example: Partition 0 has messages \[Order1, Order2], Partition 1 has \[Order3, Order4].

---

## 8. Events vs Tasks

* **Event** ‚Üí Something that **happened** (like *‚ÄúUser placed an order‚Äù*).
* **Task** ‚Üí Something that **needs to be done** (like *‚ÄúShip the order‚Äù*).

üì¶ Example:

* Event: *Order Created* (captured by Kafka).
* Task: *Send confirmation email* (done by a consumer service after reading the event).

üëâ Kafka mainly deals with **events**, and different apps decide what **tasks** to do after consuming those events.

---

## 9. How Kafka Handles Failures

Kafka makes **copies** (replicas) of every drawer (partition).

* If one broker (server) fails, another copy is used.
* Typical: 3 copies of each partition.

---

## 10. Message Delivery Types

* **At-most-once** ‚Üí Send once, may be lost, never repeated.
* **At-least-once** ‚Üí Guaranteed delivered, but could be duplicate.
* **Exactly-once** ‚Üí Guaranteed delivered and no duplicates (hardest, but Kafka supports it).

---

## 11. How Data is Stored

* Kafka messages are just **bytes**.
* Apps must agree on format ‚Üí JSON, Avro, Protobuf.
* Schema Registry ‚Üí keeps track of message format so apps don‚Äôt break.

---

## 12. Kafka Streams & Kafka Connect

* **Kafka Streams**: A library to process data while it flows. Example: count how many orders per minute.
* **Kafka Connect**: Ready-made connectors to move data between Kafka and databases, cloud storage, etc.

![Kafka Streams](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/_images/streams-interactive-queries-01.png)

---

## 13. Security Basics

* **SSL/TLS**: Locking communication.
* **SASL**: Username/password to access.
* **ACLs**: Who can read/write which topic.

---

## 14. Monitoring

Things to watch:

* Consumer lag (is reader catching up?).
* Broker health (servers up?).
* Disk space (enough space for messages?).

---

## 15. Performance Tips

* More partitions ‚Üí more parallelism.
* Use compression (snappy/gzip) to save space.
* Keep messages small (< 1 MB is good).

---

## 16. Local Setup with Docker

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.4.0
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.4.0
    ports:
      - 9092:9092
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: 'zookeeper:2181'
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
```

Run:

```bash
# create topic
kafka-topics --create --topic orders --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1

# send a message
kafka-console-producer --topic orders --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
> order123

# read message
kafka-console-consumer --topic orders --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

---

## 17. Code Examples

### Java Producer

```java
Properties p = new Properties();
p.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
p.put("key.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
p.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
Producer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(p);
producer.send(new ProducerRecord<>("orders", "orderId", "123"));
producer.close();
```

### Python Consumer

```python
from confluent_kafka import Consumer

c = Consumer({
    'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092',
    'group.id': 'mygroup',
    'auto.offset.reset': 'earliest'
})

c.subscribe(['orders'])
while True:
    msg = c.poll(1.0)
    if msg is None: continue
    print(msg.value().decode('utf-8'))
```

## 18. Ecosystem

* **Schema Registry** ‚Üí define message format.
* **Kafka Connect** ‚Üí move data in/out.
* **Kafka Streams** ‚Üí process messages.
* **MirrorMaker** ‚Üí copy messages across clusters.

---

## 19. Dependent Topics

* **ZooKeeper vs KRaft**: Old Kafka needed ZooKeeper. Newer Kafka uses KRaft (built-in system). Easier setup.
* **JVM**: Kafka runs on Java. Needs memory tuning.
* **Disk & Network**: Fast disks = faster Kafka.

---

## 20. Best Practices

* Always set replication factor ‚â• 3.
* Don‚Äôt make too many partitions (start small).
* Monitor consumer lag.
* Secure your cluster.
* Use Schema Registry for structured messages.
